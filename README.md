# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Learning Repository

This repository is a collection of my personal learning and practice in Machine Learning.  
Each folder represents a separate topic, where I go from EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to model building, evaluation, and validation for that algorithm.

## ðŸ“˜ Supervised Learning
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

---

## ðŸ§© Unsupervised Learning â€” Clustering
- K-Means Clustering  
- Hierarchical Clustering  
- DBSCAN  

---

## ðŸ“¦ Pattern Discovery & Recommendation
- Association Rule  
- Recommendation System

Each folder has its own dataset, preprocessing steps, and performance analysis to understand the algorithm end-to-end.
