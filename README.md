#  Machine Learning Learning Repository

This repository is a collection of my personal learning and practice in **Machine Learning**.  
Each folder represents a separate topic, where I go through the complete pipeline â€” from **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** to **model building**, **evaluation**, and **validation** for that algorithm.

---
Currently, it includes implementations of 
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Means Clustering
3. Hierarchical Clustering
4. DBSCAN
5. Recommendation System
6. Association Rule

Each folder has its own dataset, preprocessing steps, and performance analysis to understand the algorithm end-to-end.
